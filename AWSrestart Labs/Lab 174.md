# Lab 174 Scale and Load Balance Your Architecture

# Create target group
Under listeners and routing

Basic config
ALB

# Need Target Group
4 types
    1. Instances
    2. IP Addresses
    3. Lambda Function
    4. Application Load Balancer (ALB)

For some reason, ALB does not show up as a Target Group when creating an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
Using the instances type, the rest of the lab still worked normally
