# Lab 177 Challenge Lab: AWS Lambda Exercise
Create a Lambda function to count the number of words in a text file
Use Python to create a Lambda function 
Report the word count in an email using SNS topic
    Optional SMS (text) message
Format: <The word count in the file <textFileName> is nnn.>
Email subject line: Word Count Result
Automatically trigger the function when the text file is uploaded to an S3 bucket

# TODO Python
Open text file
Count words
    words are separated by spaces (" ") and newlines (\n)
    I will assume punctuation is always besides a word
return the word count
    (for loop?)

# TODO AWS Management Console
Return format
    The word count in the file <textFileName> is nnn.
Email subject
    Word Count Result

S3 bucket trigger on file upload
    Will only count txt files (.txt)

# Steps, remember to use the LambdaAccessRole to create the objects and functions
# steps can be done in differing orders
1. Create s3 bucket that the text file will be taken from
    textfiles4555
2. Create the lambda function
3. Add the s3 trigger for when a text file is uploaded
    suffix: .txt
